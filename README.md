# SQL_heart_diseas_analysis
SQL analysis project using Kaggle Heart Disease dataset

**1. Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing a Heart Disease dataset using SQL.
The objective is to identify key health factors that influence the likelihood of heart disease and generate insights using SQL queries.

**2. Objective / Problem Statement**

  The goal of this project is to answer important analytical questions such as:
  Which factors are strongly associated with heart disease?
  How do age, chest pain type, and other parameters affect heart disease?
  What patterns can help medical professionals take preventive action?

**  3. Dataset Description**
  Dataset Name: heart
  Tables Used : heart
  age – Age of the patient
  sex – Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
  cp – Chest pain type
  trestbps – Resting blood pressure
  chol – Cholesterol level
  fbs – Fasting blood sugar
  restecg – ECG results
  thalach – Maximum heart rate
  exang – Exercise-induced angina
  oldpeak – Depression induced by exercise
  slope – Slope of ST segment
  ca – Number of major vessels
  thal – Thalassemia
  target – (1 = Patient has heart disease, 0 = No heart disease)

**  4. SQL Skills Used**
This project includes examples of:
Basic SELECT queries
Filtering & sorting
Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
GROUP BY & HAVING
JOINs
Subqueries
CTEs
Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
Case Statements
Analytical Queries

**5. Key Insights**
 Patients with chest pain type 3 show the highest heart disease rate.
 Cholesterol and resting BP significantly differ between healthy vs affected groups.
 Males aged 50+ appear more frequently in the high-risk category.

**6. How to Run This Project**
  Download the dataset
  Import it into MySQL / PostgreSQL
  Run each SQL query step-by-step
  Review insights based on outputs

 ** 7. Tools Used**
  MySQL Workbench
  GitHub
